# ENG 668K - 2015

Welcome to the ENG 668K GitHub repository for "Reimagining the Archive".

## Getting started

A group "leader" should **fork** this repository to her or his GitHub account. Click "fork" on the top-right corner of the screen.

Once forked, go to the your fork's settings (on the right hand side menu) and add members of your group as collaborators.

Now every member of the group should **clone** the forked repository on their own computer for off-line work

## Key git operations

* **Fork**: duplicate someone else's repository to make your own changes
* **Clone**: copy the repository to your computer
* **Commit**: save a change to your local clone
* **Push**: send the your changes to GitHub 
* **Pull**: update your local clone with changes made by your collaborators

## Week 1

The folder `images` contains two facsimile images of the draft of Shelley's poem "My lost William", MS HM 2177, ff. 45vâ€“46v

The folder `transcription` contains two blank text file, one per image. Write your transcription on these files collaboratively, either online on the GitHub editor, or offline (on your local clone) with a plain text editor (i.e. not MS Word).

While transcribing consider how will you deal with:

* line breaks
* authorial revisions
* interlinear insertions
* unclear text or text you can't quite read from the page
